### List of tasks that I hope to design 


1. Motor learning tasks using mouse : https://p5js.org/examples/input-mouse-signals.html - Use something like this. Couple of ideas: VMRs + more complex perturbations. Also: arbitrary sequence (e.g. make mouse draw a very specific pattern, see how well they improve with / without visual feedback - sort of like a hidden maze / tubes task that they have to figure out)

2. Foraging tasks: Create a maze of objects, see the order in which we forage. 

3. Task-switching/effort allocation: A two-step task. First, choose which task to complete. Second, complete a set of trials to get the points. If you finish 5 correct trials of each task, you get a reward. We can then vary the individual rewards + the difficulty of trials in each task. Once they complete a given task, they then must switch to another task (and complete all before getting a new set of 3 tasks). At any point, they can harvest their tokens.
