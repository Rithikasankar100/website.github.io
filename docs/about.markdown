#### **CURRENT:** Contextual modulation of sensorimotor behavior 

How are our brains are able to flexibly guide how we perceive, decide, and act in the face of varying incentives and challenges. To study this, we design novel [behavioral tasks](https://adithyanarayan101.github.io/jsFocus), record from populations of neurons in visual, prefrontal, and motor cortices, and use computational tools to link behavior to brain activity.

**Reward and difficulty drive distinct changes in behavior and cortical activity** <br>
