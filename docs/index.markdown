## Hi. I'm Rithika Sankar. Welcome to my website! 
<br>
I'm doing my PhD in Systems Biology with Dr. Sarah Hainer at the University of Pittsburgh.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS Bangalore, India). Before that, I worked at the University of Washington Seattle with Dr. Hannelle Ruola Baker. I studied Genetic Engineering at SRM.
