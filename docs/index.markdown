## Hi! I'm Adi. Welcome to my website! 
<br>
I'm doing my PhD in Neuroscience with the amazing MS.SCABBY ([Matt Smith](https://smithlab.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Steve Chase](https://chaselab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Aaron Batista](https://smile.pitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}, & [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/){:target="_blank"}) at [CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about){:target="_blank"} & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I study how our brains are able to flexibly guide our perception, decision making, and motor execution in the face of varying incentives and challenges. To study this, we design novel [behavioral tasks](https://adithyanarayan101.github.io/jsFocus), record from populations of neurons in visual, prefrontal, and motor cortices, and use computational tools to link behavior to brain activity.

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Center for Neuroscience at IISc Bangalore. Before that, I studied Engineering Physics at NIT Calicut.
