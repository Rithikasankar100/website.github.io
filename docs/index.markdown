## Hi! I'm Adi. Welcome to my website! 
<br>
I'm doing my PhD in Neuroscience with the amazing MSSCABBY ([Matt Smith](https://smithlab.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Steve Chase](https://chaselab.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Aaron Batista](https://smile.pitt.edu/){:target="_blank"}, & [Byron Yu](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~byronyu/){:target="_blank"}) at [CNUP](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/about){:target="_blank"} & [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} (Pitt/CMU). 

Previously, I was a research assistant at the Center for Neuroscience at the Indian Institute of Science. Before that, I studied Engineering Physics at NIT Calicut.
