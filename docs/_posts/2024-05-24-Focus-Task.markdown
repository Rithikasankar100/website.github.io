Here's a browser-based implementation of a difficult sensorimotor task using [JSPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/). We designed this task to study how different forms of difficulty - perceptual difficulty and motor difficulty - impact different aspects of sensorimotor behavior. 

You can perform the task here: [Focus Task](https://adithyanarayan101.github.io/jsFocus)
